# My personal notes on Assembly

The inevitable question: why?

I think the best answer is: power.

Using Assembly, we have the power at hand to access the bare metal of the processor, which can help in many cases to achieve high performance. And according to Hoey (2019), we can learn how high-level language compilers generate machine language, and this knowledge helps to write more efficient code.
