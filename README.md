## Notes about F2Py

* https://numpy.org/doc/stable/f2py/

F2PY provide a connection between Python and F90 languages, and allows you to bring together the best of both worlds. It is not a replacement for F90, it is just a way to take advantage of the rapidly developing features of the Python ecosystem without having to reinvent the wheel.
