# My personal notes on Fortran

Fortran, in the latest version, is a modern programming language, including support for object-oriented programming (type extension and inheritance, polymorphism, dynamic type allocation, procedures linked to type), and support for parallel programming (coarray, looping , array assignment, vectorization help, GPU). It can also be used in conjunction with Python (NumPy F2Py) to create modules to be used interactively in a Jupyter Notebook, bringing together the best of these languages and environments. None is better than the other, each has its own application. Fortran is developed by the Working Group 5 of Sub-Committee 22 of the Joint Technical Committee 1 of the International Organization for Standardization and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC). This group is known as WG5. [*(Source)*](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gfortran/Fortran-2008-status.html)

## Intel Fortran

Intel oneAPI Toolkits are available at no cost and do not require license files. Includes _ifort_ Intel Fortran Compiler Classic (Full 77, 90, 95, 2003, 2008, and 2018), and _ifx_ Intel Fortran Compiler Beta (Full 77, 90, 95, and partial 2003). ifx uses the LLVM back-end technology and is released as a Beta version for users interested in trying Intel Gen9 GPU offloading, which ifort does not support

## Notes on F2Py

F2PY provide a connection between Python and F90 languages, and allows you to bring together the best of both worlds. It is not a replacement for the F90, it is just a way to take advantage of the rapidly developing features of the Python ecosystem, and in this way without having to reinvent the wheel

* https://numpy.org/doc/stable/f2py/

Perhaps the best way to use it is in conjunction with Jupyter Notebook, as in this example (note the use of both languages):
