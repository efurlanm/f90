## Notes about F2Py

F2PY provide a connection between Python and F90 languages, and allows you to bring together the best of both worlds. It is not a replacement for the F90, it is just a way to take advantage of the rapidly developing features of the Python ecosystem, and in this way without having to reinvent the wheel.

Perhaps the best way to use it is in conjunction with Jupyter Notebook, as in this example (note the use of both languages):
